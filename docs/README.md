# Limonata
Limonata is an open-source platform for ChemE students, educators, and hobbyists to prototype their ideas with Arduino. It uses a C/C++/Arduino API for the firmware and Python wrapping and abstraction layers for ease-of-use and integration with machine learning. Inspired by the elegance and simplicity of the TCLab, Limonata seeks to bridge the barriers to entry for chemical engineering education, prototyping, and hobbyism alike. 

Our first objective is to create a platform capable of creating mineral lemonade, meaning carbonated lemonade. This is because as a goal it compels us to work with flow control for the most predominant states/phases of matter--solids (sugar), liquids (water), solutions (lemon juice), and gases (carbon dioxide). 
Once this objective has been met, we should expect to experiment with more complex processes.

We also anticipate the introduction of a GUI for easy prototyping and control applications. This is in development.
