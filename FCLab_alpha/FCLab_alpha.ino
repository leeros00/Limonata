 * NOTE:
 * While the original code was intended for the TCLab, the main goal now of this file is to build a flow controller with Arduino
 * All the notes after these asterixes are based on the notes given from the TCLab-sketch.ino file.
 * What we will need to do is examine the firmware and software in detail to understand how the methods work.
 * Of utmost importance is to first dissect and comment the firmware so we know how all methods are called. 
 * Then, we will examine how the Python files are called via Dr. Hedengren's software.
 * Once we understand how everything is compiled and called, we will be able to create our own methods for the flow controller.

  TCLab Temperature Control Lab Firmware
  Jeffrey Kantor, Bill Tubbs, John Hedengren, Shawn Summey
  February 2021

  This firmware provides a high level interface to the Temperature Control Lab. The
  firmware scans the serial port for commands. Commands are case-insensitive. Any
  unrecognized command results in sleep model. Each command returns a result string.

  A         software restart. Returns "Start".
  LED float set LED to float for 10 sec. range 0 to 100. Returns actual float
  pumpPower float  set pwm limit on heater 1, range 0 to 255. Default 200. Returns pumpPower.
  valvePower float  set pwm limit on heater 2, range 0 to 255. Default 100. Returns valvePower.
  pumpQ float  set Heater 1, range 0 to 100. Returns value of pumpQ.
  valveQ float  set Heater 2, range 0 to 100. Returns value of valveQ.
  pumpQB float set Heater 1, range 0 to 100. Returns value of pumpQ as a 32-bit float.
  valveQB float set Heater 2, range 0 to 100. Returns value of valveQ as a 32-bit float.
  R1        get value of Heater 1, range 0 to 100
  R2        get value of Heater 2, range 0 to 100
  SCAN      get values T1 T2 pumpQ pumpQ in line delimited values
  T1        get Temperature T1. Returns value of T1 in 째C.
  T2        get Temperature T2. Returns value of T2 in 째C.
  T1B       get Temperature T1. Returns value of T1 in 째C as a 32-bit float.
  T2B       get Temperature T2. Returns value of T2 in 째C as a 32-bit float.
  VER       get firmware version string
  X         stop, enter sleep mode. Returns "Stop"

  Limits on the heater power can be configured with the constants below.

  Status is indicated by LED1 on the Temperature Control Lab. Status conditions are:

      LED1        LED1
      Brightness  State
      ----------  -----
      dim         steady     Normal operation, heaters off
      bright      steady     Normal operation, heaters on
      dim         blinking   High temperature alarm on, heaters off
      bright      blinking   High temperature alarm on, heaters on

  The Temperature Control Lab shuts down the heaters if it receives no host commands
  during a timeout period (configure below), receives an "X" command, or receives
  an unrecognized command from the host.

  Constants are used to configure the firmware.
