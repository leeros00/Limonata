# Limonata
Limonata is an open-source platform for ChemE students, educators, and hobbyists to prototype their ideas. 
Inspired by the elegant simplicity of the TCLab, Limonata seeks to bridge the barriers to entry for chemical engineering education, startups, and hobbyists alike. 
Currently it is in development and even the name is subject to change.
